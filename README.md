# Space Invaders

**Replicating the hit classic, "Space Invaders" in the Unity Game Engine.**

## Summary and Rules

* Playing as a ship, your goal is to shoot down all enemies accross from you. You can move left and right with the "A" and "D" keys respectively. In addition, to shoot projectiles, simply press the "SPACE" key and watch it fly.

* When a bullet hits one of the Enemies/Invaders, they are immediately destroyed and a point is added to the players score count. However, the invaders can fire back, and if the player is hit, they lose a life; having a grand total of 3 lives.

* The enemies/invaders also have another way of defeating the player. They slowly move towards the player in a zig-zag pattern. Once they reach, the player, the player will automatically lose.

* The game can end in two ways. Either the player runs out of lives, or all enemies have been defeated. The player will then be redirected to the game over screen. Simply press the "ENTER" key to go back to the title screen.
